# Game Engine

A game engine made with only wgpu and winit as the backend with lua used as the scripting language to interface with the game engine.
Made In Rust and cross-platform across windows, macos and linux.

## Asset Storing

Assets are stored in the assets/ folder which have a textures folder which holds textures and a res folder which holds models, during compile time they are archived into a tar file written as game.assets
